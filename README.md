# Android App Template

This is a GitHub template repository intended to kickstart development on an Android application. This project comes set with a handful of tools that [Adam](https://github.com/AdamMc331) finds important and relevant to every project. It's also a little opinionated in terms of how dependencies are set up. 

At the moment, Adam intends to use this for his own projects, but will come back and document this more thoroughly if others are interested in using the same setup. It's also intended just to spin up apps for demo projects, not necessarily worrying about production yet either.
